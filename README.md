# Seaborn 

*  Seaborn is a statical plotting library 
*  It has default beautiful styles 
*  It aso is designed to work very well with pandas datafram objects 


## As Part of Seaborn execerve we will study below topics

* [01Distribution Plots](https://github.com/sujitdhamale/Seaborn/blob/master/01%20Distribution%20Plots.ipynb)

   In Distribution Plots will see plots that allow us to visualize the distribution of a data set. These plots are:
    * Distribution Plots (distplot)
    * Joints Plots (jointplot)
    * Pairplot (pairplot)
    * Rugplot (rugplot)
    * KDE(Kernel Density Estimates)  Plot (kdeplot)

* [02Categorical Plots](https://github.com/sujitdhamale/Seaborn/blob/master/02%20Categorical%20Plots.ipynb)

  In Categorical Plots we will see below plots
    * barplot
    * countplot
    * boxplot
    * violinplot
    * stripplot
    * factorplot
    * swarmplot
* [03Matrix Plots](https://github.com/sujitdhamale/Seaborn/blob/master/03%20Matrix%20Plots.ipynb)<br>
Matrix plots allow you to plot data as color-encoded matrices and can also be used to indicate clusters within the data (later in the machine learning section we will learn how to formally cluster data).<br>
In Matrix Plots we will see below plots 
    * Heatmap
    * clustermap

* [04Grid](https://github.com/sujitdhamale/Seaborn/blob/master/04%20Grids.ipynb)

   Grids are general types of plots that allow you to map plot types to rows and columns of a grid, this helps you create similar plots separated by features
    * PairGrid
    * Facet Grid
    * JointGrid

* [05Regression Plots](https://github.com/sujitdhamale/Seaborn/blob/master/05%20Regression%20Plots.ipynb)

   In regression plot we will see
    * lmplot<br>
    ##### along wit it  we will see 
    * Working with Markers
    * Using a Grid
    * Aspect and Size
