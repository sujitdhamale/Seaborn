# Seaborn 

*  Seaborn is a statical plotting library 
*  It has default beautiful styles 
*  It aso is designed to work very well with pandas datafram objects 


## As Part of Seaborn execerve we will study below topics

* [01Distribution Plots](https://github.com/sujitdhamale/Seaborn/blob/master/01%20Distribution%20Plots.ipynb)

   In Distribution Plots will see plots that allow us to visualize the distribution of a data set. These plots are:
    * Distribution Plots (distplot)
    * Joints Plots (jointplot)
    * Pairplot (pairplot)
    * Rugplot (rugplot)
    * KDE(Kernel Density Estimates)  Plot (kdeplot)

* [02Categorical Plots](https://github.com/sujitdhamale/Seaborn/blob/master/02%20Categorical%20Plots.ipynb)

  In Categorical Plots we will see below plots
    * barplot
    * countplot
    * boxplot
    * violinplot
    * stripplot
    * factorplot
    * swarmplot
* [03Matrix Plots](https://github.com/sujitdhamale/Seaborn/blob/master/03%20Matrix%20Plots.ipynb)

Matrix plots allow you to plot data as color-encoded matrices and can also be used to indicate clusters within the data (later in the machine learning section we will learn how to formally cluster data).
In Matrix Plots we will see below plots Heatmap clustermap
